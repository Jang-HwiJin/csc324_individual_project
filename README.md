StockTool is an interactive R Shiny app that allows users to explore and analyze FAANG (Facebook(Meta), Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) stock prices. It also
utilizes Machine Learning using the h2o package and provides a end of the day stock prediction for an individual stock. 

To Use the Application:
1. Make sure all the pacakges are installed
2. Put the pacakges into the library
3. Press Ctrl + A and then Enter. Do not just press "Run Program". You may adjust the seed and max_time for the Machine Learning to fine tune your model.
4. After it has finished running, stop the program and press "Run Prorgram" green button. It will not correctly load the app.
